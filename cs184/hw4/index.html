    <h1>CS 184 Homework 4 Write-Up</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      We built a cloth simulation that uses a grid of point masses connected by springs to mimic real cloth behavior. We implemented Verlet
      integration to update the clothâ€™s motion over time, including gravity, collision handling with objects and self-collision using spatial
      hashing, and spring corrections. On the graphics side, we wrote several shaders for effects like diffuse lighting, Phong shading,
      texture mapping, bump mapping, displacement mapping, and even environment-mapped reflections. Overall, we learned how to combine
      physics-based simulation with real-time GPU shading to create dynamic, realistic cloth animations.

    </p>
    <h3>Part 1. Masses and springs</h3>
    <p>
      In this part, we implemented a mass-spring model to simulate cloth. The model consists of point masses connected
      by springs, which can be used to simulate the behavior of cloth under various conditions. We created a grid of
      point masses and added structural, shear, and bending constraints to the springs connecting them. These constraints
      can be toggled on and off to observe their effects on the cloth simulation. The image below shows the wireframe of
      the cloth with different constraints applied.

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Part 2. Simulation via numerical integration</h3>
    <p>
      For this part, we used Verlet integration to compute the new positions of the point masses in the cloth simulation. To that end, we first
      computed the total force acting on each point mass, which included both external forces (like gravity) and spring correction forces. The
      spring correction forces were calculated using Hooke's law, and we applied them to the two masses at the ends of each spring. We also added 
      a damping term to simulate energy loss due to friction and heat. 
    </p>
    <p>
      After computing the forces, we used Verlet integration to update the positions of the point masses. This method approximates the new position
      based on the current position, previous position, and the total acceleration. We also implemented a constraint to ensure that the springs did not
      become unreasonably deformed during each time step. This was done by correcting the positions of the two point masses connected by a spring to
      ensure that the spring's length was at most 10% greater than its rest length.
    </p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      We can change the parameters of the simulation to observe different behaviors. For example, a very low spring constant (ks) results in a cloth that
      behaves very loosely and does not hold its shape well, while a high spring constant results in a stiffer cloth that retains its shape better.
      Similarly, changing the density of the cloth affects its weight and how it interacts with gravity. A higher density results in a heavier cloth that
      falls faster, while a lower density results in a lighter cloth that falls more slowly. The damping term also affects the simulation; a higher damping
      value results in a cloth that loses energy more quickly, causing it to come to rest faster. Meanwhile, a low damping term results in a cloth that retains
      its energy longer and bounces more, making it swing back and forth.

    <h3>Part 3. Handling collisions with other objects</h3>
    <p>
      In this part, we implemented collision detection and response for the cloth simulation. We added support for collisions with spheres and planes,
      allowing the cloth to interact with these objects in a realistic manner. The collision detection is done by checking if the point mass is inside
      the sphere or plane, and if so, we adjust its position to be just outside the surface of the object. For spheres, we compute the tangent point where the point mass
      intersects the sphere and adjust its position accordingly. For planes, we compute the tangent point where the point mass intersects the plane and adjust
      its position to be slightly above the tangent point, on the same side of the plane that the point mass was before crossing over. We also account for friction
      by scaling the correction vector by (1 - f), where f is the friction coefficient.

    </div>
    
    <h3>Part 4. Handling self-collisions</h3>
    <p>
      Here, we handle self collisions by implementing a spatial hashing algorithm. This allows us to efficiently detect and resolve collisions
      between point masses in the cloth simulation. The algorithm works by partitioning the 3D space into smaller boxes and mapping each point
      mass to the box it occupies. When checking for collisions, we only need to check point masses that are in the same or neighboring boxes,
      significantly reducing the number of comparisons needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, we compute the dimensions of the boxes based on the size of the cloth and the number of point masses. We then truncate the coordinates
      of each point mass to the nearest box, effectively mapping it to a unique key. This key is used to store the point mass in a hash table, where
      the key is the box index and the value is a list of point masses in that box. When checking for collisions, we look up the point mass's box
      index and check for collisions with other point masses in the same box. If a collision is detected, we compute a correction vector to separate
      the point masses and apply it to the point mass that is not colliding with itself. The final correction vector is the average of all pairwise
      correction vectors, scaled down by the number of simulation steps to improve accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image below shows the cloth simulation with self-collisions enabled. You can see how the cloth folds on itself and interacts with the plane
      without clipping through it. The cloth retains its shape and behaves more naturally as it falls.

    <p>
      Changing the density and spring constant (ks) affects the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself. A higher density results in a heavier cloth
      that falls faster and interacts more strongly with itself. A higher spring constant results in a stiffer cloth that retains its shape better and
      is less likely to fold on itself. The images below show the cloth with different densities and spring constants.

    <h3>Part 5. Cloth Sim</h3>
    <p>
      A shader program is a small set of instructions that runs on the GPU to process images quickly, 
      and it uses two main parts: the vertex shader and the fragment shader. 
      The vertex shader works on each point (or vertex) of a 3D model, 
      transforming its position and calculating extra data like normals or texture coordinates. 
      Then, the fragment shader uses these smooth, interpolated values to figure out the final color of each pixel, 
      adding effects like lighting, textures, and material details to make the scene look realistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model is a method we use to calculate the color and brightness 
      of a surface by breaking the light into three parts: ambient, diffuse, and specular. 
      Ambient light is like a base level that lights everything evenly, 
      diffuse light depends on how directly the surface faces the light, 
      and specular light creates shiny highlights when the light reflects toward our eyes. 
      A key part of this model is using a "halfway" vector, which is the average direction between the light source and the viewer, 
      making it simpler to calculate the strength of the specular highlights.

      Bump mapping gives an illusion of surface details by tweaking the way light interacts with a flat surface, 
      so while it makes cloth and spheres look textured, their actual shapes remain unchanged. Displacement mapping, 
      on the other hand, physically alters the surface geometry, resulting in a more wrinkly, pronounced, 
      and realistic texture that changes the silhouette of the object.

      In our tests, bump mapping only alters the surface normals, so the sphereâ€™s outline remains the same regardless of mesh resolution.
      With a coarse mesh (-o 16 -a 16), the bump mapping shows some blocky shading due to large polygons, but the overall shape is smooth.
      By contrast, displacement mapping changes the actual geometry. On a coarse sphere, the displaced bumps appear jagged and faceted because
      there arenâ€™t enough vertices to capture smooth curves, while on a finer mesh (-o 128 -a 128) the geometry deforms more naturally, yielding 
      a smoother, more realistic surface.

      We created a custom shader that combines five techniques into a single material. 
      In our vertex shader, we use a height map to offset each vertex along its normal (displacement mapping),
      which gives our geometry actual bumps. In the fragment shader, we blend a base texture with a user-defined color, 
      then use the same height map to adjust the normals (bump mapping) for better lighting via a Phong model. 
      We also calculate a reflection vector to sample an environment map (cube map) for mirror-like reflections, 
      and finally, we mix the lit surface with the reflective output using a time-modulated factor to add a dynamic, shiny effect.
