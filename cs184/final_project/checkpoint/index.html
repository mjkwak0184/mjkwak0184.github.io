    <h1>CS 184 Final Project Progress Report: Toon Shading Implementation</h1>

    <h2>1. Summary of Accomplishments</h2>
    <p>
        Developed a standalone C++ OpenGL application (using GLEW, GLFW, GLM) as an NPR testbed. Implemented a core GLSL toon/cel shader
        with quantized lighting. Integrated <code>tinyobjloader</code> for loading <code>.obj</code> models (e.g., Teapot) and added
        basic mouse rotation/zoom controls. Successfully debugged and resolved model loading issues related to missing vertex normals.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Preliminary Results</h2>
    <p>
        The application renders <code>.obj</code> models (with normals) correctly using the toon shader, displaying characteristic flat color bands.
        Shading dynamically responds to model rotation relative to the light source. The interactive framework is stable and suitable
        for further shader experimentation.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Reflection on Progress Relative to Plan</h2>
    <p>
        Progress aligns with Week 1 goals (framework setup) and partially with Week 2-3 (implemented one NPR style - toon shading). However,
        we are lagging on implementing other proposed NPR styles (sketch, watercolor, pixel), integrating with path tracing (current work
        uses rasterization), performing PBR comparison, and efficiency analysis. Valuable shader development experience gained, but scope
        needs adjustment or acceleration.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Updated Work Plan</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Unless advised otherwise, we will continue working with OpenGL shaders and next steps will be implementing more NPR shader techniques
            (outlines, watercolor, etc.) and a PBR shader for comparison. We anticipate purely-photorealistic-based-rendering to be harder to
            implement and might need to restrict our focus to NPR.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once we have constructed some initial implementations of some more convoluted shading techniques, we will release a google form on Ed
            to the class to gauge whether the output conveys the desired effect. For example, we could ask “On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1
            being ‘strongly disagree’ and 10 being ‘strongly agree’) would you agree that this image is something you might see in a comic
            book?” Shaders which report poor correlation with the intended style might need to be reworked. We could also include an open-ended
            feedback section where students can share which aspects of the image they specifically like or dislike.
        </li>
    </ul>
