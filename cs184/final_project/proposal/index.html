    <h1>CS 184 Final Project Proposal: Exploring Non-Photorealistic Rendering</h1>

      <h2>Title, Summary and Team Members</h2>
      <h3 style="font-weight:bold; font-style: italic;">Exploring Non-Photorealistic Rendering</h3>
      <p>Our project aims to explore different NPR shading schemes applied to object rendering and compare their effects with PBR shading. 
        Some of the NPR techniques we will be exploring include: sketch-like, cel-shading, pixel shading, and watercolor rendering. We will also attempt to make
        effeciency comparisons between the NPR and PBR techniques.</p>
      <p>Team Members: Minjae Kwak, Zixun Wang, Shashwat Bansal, Jaymes Ryan Garbe</p>

      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <p>Our project focuses on exploring non-photorealistic rendering techniques—such as toon shading and 
        cel-shading—to create expressive visuals that offer both clarity and artistic flexibility beyond traditional photorealistic rendering (PBR).
         By integrating resources like the Toon Shader Pack with custom path tracing methods, we aim to overcome PBR's limitations, 
         providing enhanced creative expression for applications ranging from architectural visualization to unique artistic portrayals.</p>

      <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
      <h3>Baseline Plan</h3>
      <p>For a successful project outcome, we plan to deliver a fully functional non-photorealistic rendering engine 
        that incorporates multiple artistic styles such as toon shading, cel shading, and watercolor effects. Essential goals include ensuring smooth, 
        interactive performance, implementing robust shader pipelines, and maintaining a modular design that supports future enhancements and experimentation.</p>
      <h3>Aspirational Plan</h3>
      <p>If everything goes well, we aim to enhance the efficiency of our non-photorealistic rendering pipeline 
        through streamlined shading models and optimized algorithms. Unlike traditional PBR, which often demands high computational resources for realism,
         our approach will focus on reducing overhead and accelerating rendering times while maintaining distinct, artistic visual quality.</p>

        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p>
          Over the next four weeks, our team will work in stages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Finalize the concept and set up the basic project framework.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Begin development of core rendering features (pathtracer) and implement initial efficiency improvements.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Refine our techniques and implement more NPR techniques, including comparing our approach to traditional PBR.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Conduct final testing, polish the project, and prepare for the presentation.</li>
        </ul>
