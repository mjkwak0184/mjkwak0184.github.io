    <h2>Section 1. Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>
    <h3>Part 1. Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>
    <p>
      In this part, we implemented de Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate Bezier curves. This algorithm recursively
      subdivides the control points of a Bezier curve to find the final evaluated point. Given a set of control
      points, the algorithm computes the intermediate points at each level of subdivision until the final point
      is reached. This is done by linearly interpolating between each pair of points at each level, as detailed by
      the formula below.
    </p>
    <p class="math">
      $$
      b^{n+1}_i = (1 - t) \cdot b^n_i + t \cdot b^n_{i+1}
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, \(b^n_i\) represents the \(i\)-th control point at level \(n\), and \(t\) is the parameter that determines
      the position of the evaluated point along the curve. By recursively applying this formula, we can evaluate the
      Bezier curve at any point \(t\). The set of all the evaluated points from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 1\) forms the Bezier
      curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      To demonstrate the implementation of de Casteljau's algorithm, we created a Bezier curve with 6 control points
      of our choosing. The screenshots below show the evaluation of the curve at different levels of subdivision.

    <h3>Part 2. Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
    <p>
      The de Casteljau algorithm can be extended to evaluate Bezier surfaces by considering the control points as a
      two-dimensional grid. To that end, we modified the functions we implemented for Bezier curves to work with
      Bezier surfaces. The algorithm evaluates the surface at a given pair of parameters \(u\) and \(v\) by first
      evaluating the Bezier curves along the rows and columns of the control points grid, respectively. This is done
      by recursively subdividing the control points and interpolating between them to find the final point on the
      curve.
    </p>
    <p>Evaluate Along \(u\) (Rows)</p>

    <p>The function evaluate1D takes a set of 3D control points and recursively reduces them using evaluateStep until only one point remains. 
      This function is first applied to each row of control points to interpolate along \(u\), yielding a new set of intermediate control points.</p>
    
    <p>Evaluate Along \(v\) (Columns)</p>
    
    <p>The intermediate points obtained from the first step are then treated as a new Bézier curve. Applying evaluate1D again, 
      this time along \(v\), computes the final interpolated point on the Bézier surface.</p>

    <h2>Section 2. Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>
    <h3>Part 3. Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>
    <p>
      We implemented the function <code>Vertex::normal()</code> computes the area-weighted normal for a vertex by averaging the normals of adjacent faces. 
      It initializes a vector accumulator and iterates over all neighboring faces using the half-edge structure. For each face, it checks if it's a boundary, 
      then computes its normal using the cross product of two edge vectors. This normal, proportional to the face's area, is then being added to the accumulator. 
      The process repeats until all faces are considered, and the final summed normal is normalized before being returned.
    </p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Part 4. Edge Flip</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>flipEdge</code> function in <code>HalfedgeMesh</code> flips a non-boundary edge by updating its connectivity while preserving mesh topology. 
      The function first checks if the given edge is a boundary, returning immediately if true. 
      It then retrieves the associated halfedges, faces, and vertices, and storing them in temporary values, ensuring that the new configuration maintains valid references. 
      The vertex pointers are updated to reflect the new edge endpoints, while edges and faces are reassigned their correct halfedges. 
      The halfedge pointers are then restructured to reflect the flipped configuration with all components, maintaining proper adjacency and preserving mesh integrity. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We attempted debugging with trying out on the teapot mesh with GUI to see if there were holes formed, using check_for() to make sure that pointer reassignments were done correctly.
      We initially attempted to not use set_neighbours, but that resulted in a lot of holes in the mesh.

      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Part 5. Edge Split</h3>
    <p>
      For the <code>splitEdge</code> function, We implemented an edge split operation that adds a new vertex at the midpoint of a given edge. 
      If the edge is on the boundary, we first determined which halfedge was part of the interior face and used that as the reference for splitting. 
      The split created a new vertex <code>m</code> at the midpoint of the edge and introduced two new halfedges (<code>h3</code> and <code>h4</code>) to maintain proper connectivity. 
      We also created a new face (<code>f1</code>) and two new edges (<code>e3</code> and <code>e4</code>), ensuring all pointers were properly reassigned. 
      
      For non-boundary edges, We followed a similar approach but created additional halfedges (<code>h5, h5t, h6, h6t, h7, h7t</code>), two new faces (<code>f2</code> and <code>f3</code>), and three new edges (<code>e5, e6, e7</code>) to maintain a consistent mesh structure. 
      The most challenging part was ensuring all halfedge relationships, particularly twin assignments, remained correct to prevent mesh inconsistencies.
      We used the <code>check_for(...)</code> function to debug pointer assignments, especially for the twin and next halfedge relationships. 
      
      Additionally, we flagged the new edges and vertex as <code>isNew</code> to track changes, ensuring that the remeshing process remained consistent with future operations. 
      Below are images showing the mesh before and after splitting edges, a combination of edge splits and flips, as well as splits on boundaries.

    <h3>Part 6. Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
    <p>
      In this part, we implemented the loop subdivision algorithm to upsample a mesh. Upsampling is useful for converting
      a coarse polygon mesh into a higher-resolution one for better display, more accurate simulation, and other purposes.
      One of the algorithm that achieves this is loop subdivision, which subdivides each triangle in the mesh into four
      smaller triangles and updates the vertex positions based on a weighting scheme. The algorithm consists of two main
      steps: subdividing each triangle and updating the vertex positions. To implmenet loop subdivision, we first computed
      the new positions of the vertices in the original mesh. These positions are applied after the mesh is subdivided via
      edge splits and flips. The new positions are calculated based on the original vertex positions and the neighboring
      vertex positions, using the weights described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new position of a vertex splitting the shared edge \((A, B)\) between a pair of triangles \((A, C, B)\) and
      \((A, B, D)\) is given by:
    </p>
    <p class="math">
      $$
      3/8 \cdot (A + B) + 1/8 \cdot (C + D)
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      This gives the vertices closest to the edge, i.e. A and B, more weight in the new position calculation. For existing
      vertices, the updated position is calculated using all the neighboring vertices. For an existing vertex \(v\), the
      updated position is given by:
    </p>
    <p class="math">
      $$
      (1 - deg(v) \cdot u) \cdot v_{pos} + u \cdot \sum_{n \in N(v)} n_{pos}
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      where \(deg(v)\) is the degree of the vertex, \(u\) is a constant either \(3/16\) if \(deg(v) = 3\) or \( 3/(8\cdot deg(v)) \)
      otherwise. The sum is taken over all the neighboring vertices of \(v\). Once the new positions are computed, the mesh
      is subdivided by splitting the edges and flipping the edges, and we flip all new edges that connect an old vertex and
      a new vertex, i.e. the edges that does not lie on the boundary of the 4-way subdivided triangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      To demonstrate the loop subdivision algorithm, we upsampled a mesh using the loop subdivision algorithm. The screenshots
      below show the mesh before and after several iterations of loop subdivision.

    <p>
      Subdividing the cube multiple times results in an asymmetric shape. This is because the mesh for the original
      cube is not symmetric, and the subdivision algorithm does not preserve symmetry. To address this issue, we split
      the edge on each side to make a cross shape. This ensures that the mesh for each side of the cube is consistent
      and symmetric, resulting in a symmetric subdivision. The screenshots below show the cube after several iterations
      of loop subdivision with the edges split to form a cross shape.
